Due to .igc files and limited space for names (12 lines) the following is the naming convention for maps Student will use:
Total Characters: 12
m<#><mapname>[owner]
m is a constant denoting map (as .igc is used for other files)
"<#>" should be replaced with the number of teams
"<mapname>" should be replaced with the name of a map. This cannot be longer than 10 characters
"[owner]" is optional and should be replaced by a 3 letter or less identifier (i.e. sa, stu, dom, pap, )

If you plan to fully use the system, 7 characters is the max for naming.

For example, my map slither the naming convention would be: m2slitherstu

The file is 1) immediately recogniseable as a map 2) Known how many teams for the map.txt with mapname 3) easier to identify the map by starting after the number 4) have an optional identifier for the map
